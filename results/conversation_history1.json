        "Resume Feedback": "Based on the job description and the resume, here is a short feedback:\n\n**Not Suitable for the Role:**\n\nUnfortunately, the candidate's skills and experience do not align with the job requirements. While they have some data analysis and annotation experience, it is heavily focused on telecom and supply chain specific domains, whereas the job requires general data analytics and visualization skills. Additionally, the candidate's experience is mostly in industry-specific domains (telecom, supply chain, etc.), whereas the job requires experience in general data analytics and not specific to a particular industry.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\nTo be competitive for this role, I would recommend the candidate to focus on building skills in data visualization, mining, and generation, as well as gaining experience in general data analytics and not specific to a particular industry. They should also consider taking courses or certifications in data visualization and analytics to enhance their skills."
